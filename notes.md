# C compiler learnings

## Bytecode
- Bytecode is series of instructions

## Assembler
-  An assembler is an old-school program that takes a file containing human-readable mnemonic names for CPU instructions like “ADD” and “MULT” and translates them to their binary machine code equivalent.

## Disassembler
- Given a blob of machine code, disassembler spits out a textual listing of the instructions.

## Constant pool
- The constant pool is an array of values.
- They are known at compile time.
